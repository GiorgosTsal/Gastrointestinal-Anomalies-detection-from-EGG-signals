# Gastrointestinal-Anomalies-detection-from-EGG-signals
The aim of the work is to detect abnormalities of gastric function through its analysis stomach electrical activity, as recorded by an original smart belt bearing suitable sensors. The work involves the development of a computational algorithm various features of EGG and then comparison of these features between Healthy people and people suffering from Parkinson's disease. Additionally, applying machine learning techniques to explore the possibility of distinguishing between
of the two categories of users using the above as features with feature selection.
